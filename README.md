# Algorithms and Data structures


>NOTES:


#### 1. Solving a problem - algorithmic approach.  


***An algorithm must have the following characteristics:***  
**Input**: An algorithm must have well-defined input. It can be 0 or more inputs.  
**Output**: An algorithm must have well-defined output. It must match the desired output.  
**Precision**: All steps are precisely defined.  
**Finiteness**: An algorithm must stop after a certain number of steps. It should not run indefinitely.  
**Unambiguous**: An algorithm should be clear and should not have any ambiguity in any of the steps.  
**Independent**: An algorithm should be independent of any programming language or platforms.  


#### 2. Understanding Abstract Data Type (ADT)  

***ADT also defines a set of possible operations for the data. We need to understand that ADTs are mainly theoretical concepts which are used in design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software design.***


#### 3. Different data structures  

* Struct
* Array
* Linked list
* Doubly linked list
* Stack
* Queue
* Priority queue
* Set
* Map
* Tree
* Graph
* Heap


#### 4. Standard PHP Library (SPL) and data structures  
**SPL provides a set of standard data structures through Object-Oriented Programming in PHP.**  

The supported data structures are:  
**Doubly linked lists**: It is implemented in *SplDoublyLinkedList*.  
**Stack**: It is implemented in SplStack by using *SplDoublyLinkedList*.  
**Queue**: It is implemented in *SplQueue* by using *SplDoublyLinkedList*.  
**Heaps**: It is implemented in *SplHeap*. It also supports max heap in *SplMaxHeap* and min heap in *SplMinHeap*.  
**Priority queue**: It is implemented in *SplPriorityQueue* by using *SplHeap*.  
**Arrays**: It is implemented in *SplFixedArray* for a fixed size array.  
**Map**: It is implemented in *SplObjectStorage*.
